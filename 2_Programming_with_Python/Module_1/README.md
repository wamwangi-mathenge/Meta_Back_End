# Module 1: Getting Started with Python

In this module, you will get an introduction to the course and you’ll cover a brief summary of the history of programming. You will also learn the basics of how programming works and discover typical uses for Python in real-life. There are also some tips on how to take this course successfully.

Before embarking on any coding you’ll first establish if your current computer system is set up correctly and identify any required operating system dependencies. Then you’ll explore different ways that you can run programs through Python.

Next, you’ll study Python syntax using comments, variables, data types and user input and output. You’ll proceed to expand your Python skills by using math and logical operators so you can control the flow of your code and perform operations such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.

Python has multiple ways to do code loops or looping. You will examine looping constructs to iterate your code over multiple sequences.
