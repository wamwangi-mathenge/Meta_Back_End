# Module 3: Programming Paradigms

In the third module, you will cover programming paradigms, and look at the features and concepts behind procedural programming, functional programming and object oriented programming.

A key feature of procedural programming is algorithms, you will explore how they can be used to solve problems, how algorithmic complexity is calculated and learn about Big-O notation.

Next you will learn about pure functions and recursion in functional programming, as well as the difference between maps and filters.

Finally, you will explore object-oriented programming and its four main concepts.  You will explore the relationship between classes and instances in Python by creating classes, instantiating them, and accessing their variables and methods. You’ll learn about abstract classes and methods and how to implement them. The rules of method resolution and inheritance with child and parent classes are also explained. Being able to read files is essential when working with stored data in Python and you’ll discover several built-in functions to make this easier.
