# Errors & Exceptions

There are 2 types of errors:
1. Syntax Errors - These are caused by human error
2. Exceptions - Known errors that need to be handled.

### Syntax Errors
These are caused by the developer. It could be as a result of a typo or a misspelling in the code.\

## Exception Errors
They happen during code execution and can easily go unnoticed by the untrained eye.\
Exceptions need to be handled by the developer. They need to handle any issues in the codebase to keep the application from failing.

Example:\
a = 5 / 0
print(a)
